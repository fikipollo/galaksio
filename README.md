> An easy to use GUI for running Galaxy workflows.

Galaksio is a web application that simplifies the usage of the Galaxy bioinformatics platform (https://usegalaxy.org/).
Galaksio provides a simple but complete UI for using Galaxy for biologists that require bioinformatics workflows to complete their research.
Using the application, users can run any workflow implemented in the associated Galaxy instance in just few *clicks*.
Besides, the rich user interface allows customizing the execution, uploading the necessary files, downloading the results, and executing several workflows simultaneously in the background.
